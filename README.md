# Machine_Learning
Machine learning a sub-part of Artificial Intelligence. It was defined in the 1950s by Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”

Machine Learning stated by Tom M. Mitchell as "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E".

Machine Learning is classified into the following categories:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

**1. Supervised Learning: **
It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
Supervised Learning can be classified into two parts i.e. Classification and Regression.

**a) Classification: **
It accurately assign test data into specific categories based on the train data (label data). 
It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined.
Examples:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbor 
- Random Forest

**b) Regression: **
It is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. 
To predict a continuous outcome (y: Dependent Variable) based on the value of one or more predictor variables (x: Independent Variable). 
Examples:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
